# Extension Buttons - Fixed! ✅

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Missing Button Event Listeners
**Problem**: The "Scan Messages" and "Check Threats" buttons had no event listeners attached.

**Solution**: Added complete event handlers in `popup-script.js`:
- ✅ Scan Messages button now sends `scanMessages` action to content script
- ✅ Check Threats button now sends `checkThreats` action to content script
- ✅ Both buttons properly handle errors and log to console

### 2. Incorrect Script Reference
**Problem**: `popup.html` was loading `popup.js` (which doesn't exist in dev mode)

**Solution**: Updated to load `popup-script.js` instead

### 3. Status Toggle Logic
**Problem**: Toggle logic had a double-negative issue

**Solution**: Fixed the boolean logic for cleaner enable/disable switching
