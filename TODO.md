# TypeAware Refactoring Plan

## Overview
Refactor the content moderation system to improve accuracy and performance. The AI has already been merged into JS backend format, so focus on enhancing existing JS engines, expanding datasets, and adding robust features.

## Tasks

### 1. Enhance JS Detection Engines
- [ ] Improve `backend/services/contentDetectionEngine.js` with more patterns and categories
- [ ] Enhance `backend/services/fuzzyMatcher_enhanced.js` with better algorithms
- [ ] Update `backend/services/patternAnalyzer_enhanced.js` with additional behavioral patterns
- [ ] Add more obfuscation detection in `backend/services/obfuscationDetector.js`

### 2. Expand Detection Coverage
- [ ] Add more categories: general harassment, threats, hate speech, spam
- [ ] Include diverse slang, memes, and emerging abuse patterns
- [ ] Add platform-specific patterns (Twitter, Discord, gaming)
- [ ] Implement context-aware severity adjustments

### 3. Improve Model Pipeline
- [ ] Since AI is in JS, focus on rule-based improvements and pattern expansion
- [ ] Add more labeled examples for validation
- [ ] Implement confidence scoring improvements
- [ ] Add ensemble approach combining multiple detection methods

### 4. Implement Test Suite
- [ ] Create labeled test examples for all categories
- [ ] Add unit tests for detection engines
- [ ] Implement integration tests for `backend/services/aiService.js`
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks and accuracy metrics

### 5. Ensure Feature Completeness
- [ ] Verify real-time detection in `backend/controllers/aiController.js`
- [ ] Enhance rephrasing suggestions in `backend/services/rephrasingEngine.js`
- [ ] Update admin dashboard with comprehensive logs and metrics
- [ ] Test cross-platform API integration

### 6. Optimization and Monitoring
- [ ] Add caching layer for repeated analyses
- [ ] Implement monitoring and health checks
- [ ] Optimize for low latency (<100ms average)
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging

## Dependencies
- No Python dependencies needed (AI already merged to JS)
- Focus on JS performance improvements

## Followup Steps
- Run integration tests
- Performance testing
- Documentation updates
